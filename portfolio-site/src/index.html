                            Hi. I'm Isaac Striker. Welcome to my portfolio site. 
                            I've been using languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript/jQuery,
                            Ruby/Ruby on Rails, SQL and git for the past 3 years. I've put
                            that knowledge towards designing and coding websites, like this one.
                            My goal has always been to create responsive, stylized websites
                            that are uniquely mine. My efforts go towards the look, feel and
                            user-friendly designs of every website I create. Quality always comes
                            before quantity!
                        </p>

                            I've been tinkering with computer hardware/software since I was 10. My journey into the fascination of technology
                            started when I found a game development website called, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank" style="color:lightblue">"Scratch"</a>. I used to spend many hours during breaks in school 
                            playing around with code and designing levels. It all came to a head when my class began working on a big English class project.
                            I decided I would develop two short games to coincide with my essay about a book we were reading.
                            About two weeks later, I presented my work to the class and my teacher loved it. From then on, I would build and use my software
                            programming knowledge to create games, small websites and even shot some videos. I had so much fun doing this all throughout middle
                            school and yearned to be some kind of programmer when I was an adult.
                            <br>...<br>
                            Fast forward a couple years, I had decided to finish my high school education online after my Freshman year in a public high school. During this
                            time, I found a community-run online course called, the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/home" target="_blank"style="color: lightblue">"Odin Project"</a>. It's an online web development course and seemed like my kind of thing.
                            I signed up and spent the next 6 - 8 months learning several programming languages and web design techniques through the course. The programs I've
                            learned include: JavaScript, jQuery, SQL, CSS, C#, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, git and HTML. I completed the course and am now currently seeking an
                            employment opportunity as a web developer. It's been a long, and often arduous, journey into web development, but I have come out as a
                            stronger developer and person. I feel prepared and qualified to take on the role as a full-time web developer, 
                            and I'm incredibly excited to see what the future holds!
