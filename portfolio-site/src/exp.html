                        When I was in high school, my science teacher described me as an 'incredibly sharp' student, and saw my
                        work and attitude as being of the highest quality. And he was not the only one. I was an honor roll student,
                        and made high honors on occasion. I continually stuck with my work ethic and provided encouragement to those
                        around me. Today, I yearn to bring that same encouragement to a professional environment.<br>
                        While I was in middle school, I'd often talk with similar-minded classmates that were into computers <em>almost</em>
                        as much as I was. Talking with others gave me ideas about what I would do with certain class projects. I'd often go
                        home and, after homework, use game engines such as Unity or Construct 2 and learn as many coding languages as I could,
                        often until well after my curfew. This led me to begin mock-ups for a website I was doing for a Math project.<br>
                        During this time, I learned the basic languages (HTML, CSS and Javascript/jQuery) and got a high score on my project.
                        After this, I began to focus more on building small games for projects and to show to my friends rather than web design work. <br>
                        But that changed after I turned 15. I once again became interested in web design and set out to learn as much as possible. Nearly
                        3 years later, and I'm building professional-grade websites and working on the back-end to make sure everything runs smoothly.
                        Web Design is my passion, and now more than ever, I feel qualified to take on a professional role in a professional environment.
